# Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a detailed data analysis project that performs data cleaning, analysis, and visualization on a dataset. The project leverages various Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly** to explore and analyze the dataset. The key analyses involve spatial and descriptive statistics, as well as visualizations to present key findings.

### Key Steps and Analysis

#### 1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed invalid entries and records with missing values.
   - Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
   
#### 2. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Conducted a basic descriptive analysis on the dataset, providing summary statistics and an overview of the datasetâ€™s distribution.

#### 3. **Quantile Extraction**
   - Extracted data in quantile form for further analysis and to identify patterns in the distribution of key variables.

#### 4. **Spatial Analysis: Guest Origins**
   - Performed spatial analysis to understand the geographic distribution of guests by country.
   - Cleaned data further by removing bookings that were cancelled.
   
   **Visualization**: 
   - Converted the cleaned data into a choropleth world map using Plotly to visualize the home countries of guests. This map helps understand the concentration of guests across different regions.
   
   ```python
   map_guest = px.choropleth(data_frame=country_wise_data, 
                              locations=country_wise_data['country'], 
                              color=country_wise_data['No of guests'], 
                              hover_name=country_wise_data['country'], 
                              title="Home country of Guests")
   map_guest.show()
   ```

#### 5. **Analysis of Reserved vs. Assigned Room Types**
   - Analyzed if there is any difference between the reserved and assigned room types.
   - Created a pivot table between the `reserved_room_type` and `assigned_room_type` to find intersections, normalized the data by the index (reserved_room_type), and made the resulting data more readable.

#### 6. **Market Segment Analysis**
   - **6.a. Market Segment Distribution**: Analyzed the distribution of bookings by market segment and visualized the count of bookings in each market segment using a pie chart.
   
   **Visualization**: 
   - Plotted a pie chart to show the market segments and the count of bookings per segment.
   
   - **6.b. Average Price per Night (ADR) Analysis**: Analyzed the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for various room types across market segments.
   - Plotted a bar chart to compare the ADR across market segments, further breaking it down by room type (`reserved_room_type`).

#### 7. **Guest Arrival Patterns**
   - Investigated whether there is a pattern in guest arrivals over time.
   - Created a dictionary `dict_month` to map month names to their respective numeric values.
   - Added a new column `arrival_date_month_index` to convert month names into numeric values, then concatenated columns like `arrival_date_year`, `arrival_date_month_index`, and `arrival_date_day_of_month` to create a combined date column.
   
   - **Analysis**: Analyzed total guests arriving on each day and looked for any patterns in the data. The analysis revealed no significant pattern in guest arrivals over time.

#### 8. **Guest Arrival Distribution**
   - Mapped the distribution of guest arrivals using a combined histogram-line plot, where both the X and Y axes represented guest arrival data.
   - Performed an analysis of the distribution to understand the spread and trends.

   - **Mean and Median Trend Analysis**: Conducted a trend analysis on the mean and median values of guest arrivals and other key variables extracted from the previous charts.
